# Odin-Recipes
Working on the first project in the fundemental section of the odin project. 
I will be creating a basic recipe website using mostly html.
After finishing i realized that its's easy to overlook simple errors, so i'll have to make sure i check my work more than once.
i ended up getting a better feel for the comands and all around flow of things, for my first time doing this type of thing i think i did okay.
